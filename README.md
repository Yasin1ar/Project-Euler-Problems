# [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, which are mathematical and computational challenges that test my problem solving and coding skills. I am doing this as a personal project for Fun mostly and also learn new concepts.

For each problem, There is 2 scripts:

`simple` is the first program that I write that just works. It may not be the most elegant or efficient solution, but it gives the correct answer.

`best` is the fastest solution, the most efficient answer, that is not mine. I copy the most efficient code from the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) site itself after I provide the answer for that problem. I also add some explanation on how the code works and why it is better than mine.
