# [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, which are mathematical and computational challenges that test my problem solving and coding skills. I am doing this as a personal project to practice consistency, learn new concepts, and improve my JavaScript capability and ability as a web developer, but I may not use only one language for every solutions.

For each problem, I code three scripts:

1. The first one (`n_simple.js`) is the first program that I write that just works. It may not be the most elegant or efficient solution, but it gives the correct answer.
2. The second one (`n_improved.js`) is the improved version of the first program, that is better in readability and performance. I refactor the code, use better variable names, add better comments, and optimize the algorithm.
3. The third one (`n_efficient.js`) is the fastest solution, the most efficient answer, that is not mine. I copy the most efficient code from the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) site itself after I provide the answer for that problem. I also add some explanation on how the code works and why it is better than mine.

## Disclaimer

This repository is for educational purposes only. I do not claim any ownership or credit for the `n_efficient.js` solutions, which are copied from the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) site. I also do not encourage anyone to use these solutions to cheat or spoil the fun of solving the problems themselves. Please use this repository responsibly and at your own risk.

# How to run
To run the scripts, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Then, you can use the following command in the terminal:


`node n_x.js`


`n` is the problem number,
where `x` is the name of the solution you want to run (simple, better, or efficient).

# Feedback 
I welcome any feedback or suggestions on how to improve my solutions or coding style, Thank you :)
